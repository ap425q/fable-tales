# Tree Layout Optimization

## Overview
The tree layout has been optimized for better visual clarity and easier navigation.

## Spacing Improvements

### Before
```typescript
nodeWidth: 250
nodeHeight: 150
horizontalSpacing: 100  // Too compact horizontally
verticalSpacing: 150    // Too compact vertically
startY: 50             // Minimal top margin
```

### After
```typescript
nodeWidth: 250
nodeHeight: 180         // +30: Better accounts for actual node rendering
horizontalSpacing: 180  // +80: 80% increase for better horizontal separation
verticalSpacing: 220    // +70: 47% increase for better vertical separation
startY: 80             // +30: More breathing room at the top
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Better Readability**
- Nodes are easier to distinguish individually
- Text and labels don't feel cramped
- Clear visual separation between scenes

### 2. **Clearer Relationships**
- Edges are longer and easier to follow
- Parent-child connections are more obvious
- Less visual overlap

### 3. **Improved Hover Experience**
- More space to move cursor between nodes
- Hover target area feels more comfortable
- Ring indicators (purple/green) more visible

### 4. **Better Navigation**
- Easier to zoom and pan
- More intuitive spatial layout
- Reduced cognitive load

## Visual Layout

### Horizontal Spacing
```
┌─────┐     180px      ┌─────┐
│Node │ ←──────────→   │Node │
└─────┘                └─────┘
```

**Why 180px?**
- Provides comfortable gap between sibling nodes
- Allows hover indicators to be clearly visible
- Prevents edge overlapping in complex branches

### Vertical Spacing
```
┌─────┐
│Node │
└─────┘
   ↓
 220px
   ↓
┌─────┐
│Node │
└─────┘
```

**Why 220px?**
- Creates clear hierarchical levels
- Edges are visible and traceable
- Gives room for future enhancements (labels on edges, etc.)

## Algorithm Impact

The hierarchical layout algorithm now:
1. Places start node at the top with more margin (80px from top)
2. Spreads sibling nodes with 180px horizontal gaps
3. Places child levels 220px below parents
4. Centers each level horizontally around the viewport

## Viewport Fitting

The layout still automatically fits to viewport with:
- 200px padding around the tree
- Scales down if tree is too large (never scales up)
- Maintains aspect ratio
- Centers content horizontally

## Edge Cases Handled

### Wide Trees (Many Siblings)
- Automatic horizontal centering
- Scales down proportionally if needed
- Pan/zoom controls available

### Deep Trees (Many Levels)
- Automatic vertical scrolling via pan
- Consistent vertical spacing maintained
- Top nodes remain accessible

### Complex Branching
- Adequate space prevents edge crossings
- Clear parent-child relationships
- Hover highlighting works perfectly

## Testing Results

Tested with:
- ✅ 11-node story (mock data)
- ✅ Single branch (linear story)
- ✅ Wide tree (3+ siblings at one level)
- ✅ Deep tree (5+ levels)
- ✅ Complex branching (multiple choice points)

All scenarios display clearly with good spacing.

## Performance

No performance impact:
- Layout calculation is O(n) where n = number of nodes
- Happens once on load
- No re-calculation on hover
- Smooth rendering

## Customization

To further adjust spacing, modify `LAYOUT_CONFIG` in `treeLayout.ts`:

```typescript
const LAYOUT_CONFIG = {
  nodeWidth: 250,           // Logical node width for layout
  nodeHeight: 180,          // Logical node height for layout
  horizontalSpacing: 180,   // Gap between sibling nodes
  verticalSpacing: 220,     // Gap between parent and child levels
  startX: 400,              // Initial horizontal center point
  startY: 80,               // Top margin
}
```

### Recommendations

- **Horizontal spacing**: 1.5-2x node width for comfortable separation
- **Vertical spacing**: 1.5-2x node height for clear hierarchy
- **Top margin**: 50-100px to prevent cutting off start node
- **Keep ratio**: Vertical spacing should be slightly larger than horizontal

## Accessibility

Improved spacing benefits:
- Easier to click on specific nodes
- Better for users with motor control challenges
- Clear visual hierarchy for screen readers (via semantic structure)
- Larger hover target areas

## Future Considerations

With this spacing, we have room for:
- [ ] Edge labels (showing choice text)
- [ ] Node badges (status indicators)
- [ ] Minimap overlay
- [ ] Collapsed subtree views
- [ ] Annotations or notes on nodes

## Conclusion

The optimized spacing (180px horizontal, 220px vertical) provides the perfect balance between:
- Visual clarity
- Information density
- Navigation ease
- Hover interaction comfort

The tree now displays "perfectly" with clear relationships, comfortable spacing, and professional appearance.
