## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Color Scheme
- **Background**: Purple → Pink → Blue gradient for playful, welcoming feel
- **Cards**: White with shadows for clarity and focus
- **Badges**: 10 theme-specific colors for visual variety
- **Buttons**: Primary blue for main actions, gray for secondary

### Typography
- **Large Sizes**: Easy for children to read
- **Bold Headers**: Clear hierarchy
- **Readable Fonts**: System fonts for familiarity

### Interaction Design
- **Hover Effects**: Visual feedback on desktop
- **Large Touch Targets**: Easy tap on mobile
- **Immediate Feedback**: Loading states, transitions
- **Simple Navigation**: One-click to read story

### Theme Badge Colors
Carefully chosen for:
- Visual distinction
- Child appeal
- Accessibility (contrast)
- Semantic meaning

## 🔌 API Integration

### Mock Data Mode (Default)
```typescript
const [useMockData] = useState(true)
```
- Uses `mockCompletedStories` (10 sample stories)
- Simulates 500ms API delay
- Client-side sorting and pagination
- Perfect for development

### Real API Mode
```typescript
const [useMockData] = useState(false)
```
- Calls `api.stories.getAll()`
- Server-side sorting and pagination
- Real-time data from backend
- Production ready

## 📊 State Management

### Local State
```typescript
stories: Story[]            // Displayed stories
isLoading: boolean         // Initial load
isLoadingMore: boolean     // Loading more
sortBy: SortOption        // Current sort
hasMore: boolean          // More available
offset: number            // Pagination offset
error: string | null      // Error message
useMockData: boolean      // Mock toggle
```

### Data Flow
```
User Action → State Update → Fetch Data → Update Stories → Re-render
```
