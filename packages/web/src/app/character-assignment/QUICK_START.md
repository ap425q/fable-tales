# Character Assignment - Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 What is this page?

This is where you assign visual characters to the roles in your story. Every story has 4 roles that need characters assigned to them.

## 🚀 Quick Usage

### Step 1: Open the Page
After finalizing your story structure, click "Proceed to Character Assignment" from the Story Tree editor.

### Step 2: Assign Characters

**Option A - Click Method (Easier for beginners)**
1. Click on a character in the left panel → it gets a blue outline
2. Click on an empty role slot on the right → character is assigned
3. Repeat until all 4 roles are filled

**Option B - Drag & Drop Method (Faster for experienced users)**
1. Click and hold on a character in the left panel
2. Drag it over to a role slot on the right
3. Drop it when the role highlights in blue
4. Repeat until all 4 roles are filled

### Step 3: Review
Once all roles are assigned, you'll see a preview of your characters at the bottom of the page.

### Step 4: Continue
Click "Next: Background Setup →" to move on to customizing your story's backgrounds.

## 💡 Tips

- **Can't assign a character?** It's probably already assigned to another role. Each character can only be used once.
- **Made a mistake?** Click "Remove" or "Change" buttons on any role card to reassign.
- **Stuck?** The progress indicator at the top shows how many roles you've filled.
- **Need help?** Look for the blue info box at the bottom of the page for detailed instructions.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Tab` - Navigate between characters and roles
- `Enter` or `Space` - Select a character or role
- `Esc` - Clear selection

## 📱 Mobile Users

On mobile, the drag-and-drop might be tricky. Use the click method instead:
1. Tap a character
2. Tap a role slot
3. Character assigned! ✓

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Can't proceed to next step
- **Solution:** Make sure all 4 roles have characters assigned. Check the progress indicator at the top.
