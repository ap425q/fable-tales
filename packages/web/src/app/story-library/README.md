## Technical Details

### State Management

- **React Hooks**: Uses `useState` and `useEffect` for local state
- **Memoization**: `useMemo` for expensive filtering/sorting operations
- **Callbacks**: `useCallback` for optimized event handlers

### Performance Optimizations

- **Debounced Search**: 300ms delay to reduce re-renders
- **Pagination**: Limits DOM nodes to 20 cards maximum
- **Lazy Image Loading**: Images load on-demand with `loading="lazy"`
- **Memoized Filters**: Filtering and sorting only recalculates when dependencies change

### Data Flow

1. **Initial Load**: Fetches all stories on mount
2. **Client-Side Filtering**: Applies filters without API calls
3. **Client-Side Sorting**: Sorts in memory for instant response
4. **Client-Side Pagination**: Slices array for current page
5. **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately for deletions/duplications

### Mock Data

Development mode uses comprehensive mock data:

- **15 Stories**: Mix of 8 completed and 7 draft stories
- **Varied Metadata**: Different themes, formats, ages, read counts
- **Realistic Statistics**: Detailed analytics for testing
- **Random Images**: Uses Unsplash for realistic cover images

### API Integration

Ready for production with API endpoints:

- `GET /api/v1/stories` - Fetch all stories
- `DELETE /api/v1/stories/:id` - Delete story
- `POST /api/v1/stories/:id/duplicate` - Duplicate story
- `GET /api/v1/stories/:id/statistics` - Get statistics
- `POST /api/v1/stories/:id/share` - Generate share link

### Accessibility

- **ARIA Labels**: All interactive elements properly labeled
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all actions
- **Focus Management**: Modal focus trapping

- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliant color combinations

### Responsive Design

  - Desktop: 3 columns, full feature set
- **Touch Friendly**: Large tap targets (min 44x44px)
