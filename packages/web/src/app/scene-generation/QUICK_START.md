# Scene Image Generation - Quick Start

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Page

Navigate to: `/scene-generation/[storyId]`

Example: `/scene-generation/e9780360-5bdc-4c10-92a7-0a303cd7eae1`

### Prerequisites

Before reaching this page, users should have:
1. âœ… Created a story with structure
2. âœ… Assigned characters to roles

## Basic Usage

### 1. Generate All Scenes

Click the **"Generate All Scene Images"** button at the top:
- Triggers generation for all scenes
- Shows loading overlay with progress
- Updates cards as they complete
- Takes 2-5 minutes for 10-15 scenes

### 2. Review Generated Images

Browse the scene grid:
- **Green "Ready" badge** = Image generated successfully
- **Blue spinner** = Currently generating
- **Red "Failed" badge** = Generation error (click "Retry")
- **Gray placeholder** = Not yet generated

### 3. View Scene Details

Click any scene card to open the detail modal:
- See full scene text
- View large image

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **ESC** - Close modal
- **Tab** - Navigate between elements
- **Enter** - Activate focused button
- **Space** - Toggle checkbox

## Status Indicators

| Badge | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| ðŸŸ¢ Ready | Scene has image | Can regenerate or select version |
| ðŸ”µ Generating | Creating image | Wait for completion |
| ðŸ”´ Failed | Generation error | Click "Retry" |
| âšª No Image | Not generated yet | Click "Generate" or use bulk |

## Tips & Best Practices

### Generation Tips

1. **Use bulk generation first** - Faster than individual
2. **Let it complete** - Don't navigate away during generation
3. **Check failed scenes** - Retry them individually
4. **Be patient** - AI generation takes time

### Version Selection Tips

1. **Generate multiple versions** - Gives you options
2. **Review in modal** - See full size before selecting
3. **Trust your instinct** - Pick what looks best
4. **You can always regenerate** - Not permanent

### Organization Tips

1. **Use filters** - Find incomplete scenes quickly
2. **Work in batches** - Regenerate similar scenes together
3. **Check progress bar** - Know how close you are
4. **Select versions as you go** - Don't wait until the end

### Quality Tips

1. **Review all scenes** - Check for consistency
2. **Regenerate if needed** - Don't settle for poor quality
3. **Check character appearance** - Should match across scenes
4. **Verify locations** - Should match story locations

## Troubleshooting

### All Scenes Stuck in Generating

**Cause**: Polling might have stopped
**Solution**: Refresh the page - status will update

### Generation Failed for Scene

**Cause**: API error or content issue
**Solution**: Click "Retry" button - usually works second time

### Can't Complete Story

**Cause**: Some scenes don't have images
**Solution**: 
1. Use "Needs Regeneration" filter
2. Generate missing scenes
3. Try completing again

### Image Not Loading

**Cause**: Network issue or bad URL
**Solution**: 
1. Wait a moment for retry
2. Regenerate the scene if persists

### Selected Version Not Saving

**Cause**: API error (in mock mode, this is expected)
**Solution**: In production, this will persist automatically

### Modal Won't Close

**Cause**: Focus trap or event issue
**Solution**: 
1. Press ESC key
2. Click backdrop (outside modal)
3. Click X button

## Mock Data Mode

Currently using mock data for development:

**What's Mocked:**
- Scene generation (instant)
- Status polling (simulated progress)
- Version creation (random images)
- Story completion (no real save)

**What Works:**
- All UI interactions
- State management
- Component behavior
- Visual feedback

**To Switch to Real API:**
- Uncomment API calls in page.tsx
- Comment out MOCK sections
- Update API endpoints in config
- Test with real backend

## Development Notes

### File Structure
```
scene-generation/
â”œâ”€â”€ [storyId]/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx                          # Main page component
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ scene-generation.page.mock.ts     # Mock data
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                              # Full documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ FEATURES.md                            # Feature list
â””â”€â”€ QUICK_START.md                         # This file
```

### Key Dependencies
- React (hooks: useState, useEffect, useCallback, useRef)
- Next.js (useRouter, navigation)
- Components: Card, Modal, Button, LoadingSpinner
- Types from @/types and @/lib/apiTypes

### State Management
- Local component state (no global store)
- useState for UI state
- useRef for timers and polling
- Optimistic updates for better UX

## Next Steps

After completing scene generation:

1. **Preview Story** - See it in child reading mode
2. **Publish Story** - Make it available to children
3. **Share Story** - Get shareable link
4. **Create Another** - Start a new story
5. **View Analytics** - See how children interact
