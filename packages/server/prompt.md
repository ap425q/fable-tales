Uptill now we just developing mock application now we need to start populating the actual backend api located in server directory. We will first start with the post /stories/generate endpoint. so what it does is it generates a story with input data like lesson, theme, storyformat and number of characters that should be in the story. And the input should be a branched story like scene's multiple endings and choices for users. The main goal of our application is that we are building a Fairy tale generator application where a parent can create a custom fairy and a lesson that he wants to give it to his child (Which was the input to this api). Now your task is to use open_ai api and created a branched story with not more than 10 nodes.
