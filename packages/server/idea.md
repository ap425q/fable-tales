Frame Fable: A Fairy Tale Creator App
Overview

Frame Fable is a creative storytelling application designed to help parents and children co-create personalized fairy tales. The app leverages image generation models to produce visually rich, comic book-style stories that bring imagination to life.

Purpose

The core purpose of Frame Fable is to provide a fun and educational platform for families. Parents can embed meaningful lessons and morals within stories, and the app will turn them into beautifully animated, illustrated tales suitable for children.

Concept

Users (primarily parents) input short story ideas, themes, or life lessons they wish to teach.

The app uses AI-driven story generation and image synthesis models to create a cohesive, visually engaging narrative.

The story is formatted like a comic strip or animated picture book with dialogues, expressions, and actions.

The result is a personalized fairy tale, blending art and morality in a delightful way.

Features (Planned)

AI Story Generator: Turns user prompts or moral lessons into short fairy tale scripts.

AI Image Generator: Creates comic-style illustrations for each scene.

Storyboard Editor: Allows users to edit panels, text, and images for personalization.

Voice Narration (Future): Optional voice-over feature for bedtime story mode.

Lesson Templates: Pre-built story themes like honesty, kindness, courage, etc.

Goal

To empower parents and children to create, share, and enjoy custom fairy tales that combine moral education with visual storytelling, all powered by modern AI creativity.
