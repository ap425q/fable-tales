- **Character Customization**: Assign preset characters to story roles (protagonist, friend, antagonist, etc.)
- **Background Generation**: AI-generated location backgrounds with multiple versions and regeneration options
- **Scene Composition**: Automatic composite image generation combining characters and backgrounds
- **Story Management**: Complete library system with drafts, completed stories, and sharing capabilities

#### **Child Mode:**
